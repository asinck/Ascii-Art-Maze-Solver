Ascii Art Maze Solver

This takes an ascii art maze as input, and solves it.

There are currently four search algorithms inplemented:
* DFS, which does a depth-first search of the maze to find the solution.
* BFS, which does a breadth-first search of the maze to find the solution.
* A*, which expands the search node with the minimum path cost + heuristic estimate.
* Closest, which expands the search node closest to the goal.

This program was inspired by my AI class, and the UC Berkeley AI project, at http://ai.berkeley.edu .
